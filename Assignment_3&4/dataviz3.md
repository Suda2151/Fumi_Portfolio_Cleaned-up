# Assignment 3&4 <br><br><br>

## Step1 : find a data visualization<br><br>

Based on the instruction, I used the following data for my visualization.<br>

[Data visualization Link](https://www.ustravel.org/system/files/media_root/document/Research_Fact-Sheet_US-Travel-and-Tourism-Overview.pdf)<br>

There is no visualization, so it is hard to understand what this matrix info wants to show us. <br>
By picking up some of the information from the matrix sheet, I will make data visualization with storied.<br>
Current sheet is below<br><br>

## Step2 : Critique the data visualization<br><br>

This has been already assessed on 1/28/2020.<br><br>

The following is what I answered in google form.<br>
* Usefulness: 3
* Completeness: 6
* Perceptibility: 2
* Truthfulness: 5
* Intuitiveness: 4
* Aesthetics: 3
* Engagement: 6
* Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here. What stood out to you? What did you find worked really well? What didn't? What, if anything, would you do differently?<br>
Information is populated clearly. It means that data itself is reliable. Meanwhile, they don't use data visualization. It is not useful. And it takes time to understand what those data are.
In that sense, It is not good visualization though data is good. At first, data needs to be visualized for the audience to easily understand what those data want to tell.
And by clarifying what portion needs to be emphasized, the target audience also can be identified. 
And I would make new visualization according to the above points.<br>
* Who is the primary audience for this tool? Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience? Why or why not? <br>
This data is for travel agencies. Travel agencies are the primary audience. The current visualization is not enough to show them. Because by seeing these numbers, it is not easy for them to understand the trend. By knowing the number of a person who goes trips, payroll, and trend, a trip plan can be planned strategically.<br>
* Final thoughts: how successful this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here? What would you change? Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)<br>
My recommendation is whether the visualization can emphasize the point appropriately. In some cases, it does not make sense to understand what the graph wants to show. By highlighted, bold or colored, point which needs to be told should be clarified. Those had better be the point of assessment as "Effectiveness of visualization".
And in case of assessing a graph, the title and some explanations should be clear enough to understand. Those contents also needs to be assessed.<br><br>
