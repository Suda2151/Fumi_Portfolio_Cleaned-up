### Interview Contents and materials
The following link shows draft visualization that I used for the interview.<br>
[Iink to the draft graphs](/interview_draftGraph.md)


### a. The target audience I hope to reach with my story;
I targeted the person who likes to go trip using airlines. And I am targeting 2 types of audiences who like trip via airlines. One is my classmate in Telling Stories with Data class. Second is the person who has no experience for Telling Stories. Even for the audience who does not have any knowledge of Telling Story, I want to show my story to them how the current airline ranking consists of.

### b. My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview;
I selected three people. One is my classmate in Telling Stories with Data class. Second is the person who took the class in the previous semester. The third is the person who has no experience for Telling Stories. My story should be effective for not only the person who has an experience for Telling Story, but also the person who does not have any visualization experience. So, by expanding the target, I tried to get various frank opinions about my story. 

### c. Interview script;
In terms of the Interview, I asked three members. At first, I explained the storyboard from the beginning to the end and had a walkthrough for wireframe though it is under updating. The following point is what I asked them.<br>
1.	Whether the storytelling on storyboard does make sense. If not, what portion needs to be improved.
2.	Whether the wireframe(slide) shows understandable information. If not, what portion needs to be improved.
3.	Whether the current graph image is easy to understand. If not, what portion is bad. Please give me advice.
4.	Whether contents are requesting the audience to do something? If not, which portion is not clear for you from the audience perspective.<br><br>

Me: Hi! Here are my high-level wireframe and storyboard though I am still updating it. Would you mind giving me ideas behind what I made?<br>
Person 1 (No experience for visualization): Hi! Thank you for choosing me! The plan what you are going to show is very nice! The topic that you selected is a very interesting point for me. I understood that you are going to show whether there is any correlation between company revenue/passenger number ranking and customer popularity ranking, right?<br>

Me: Yes, I would like to show whether popularity links to passenger numbers directly to the audience. The background is I’m always using the same airlines without any thought, but I was wondering how other people choose airlines among many companies. And through the analysis, my criteria can be changed. And that is useful for not only me but also the audience to find more better airlines! For airline side also has a benefit if they might have a chance to have new customers who continue to select in the future. This type of information I want to share with the audience through my visualizations.<br>

Person 1 (No experience for visualization): OK! I ‘m not familiar with visualization, but let me give what I thought for the current slide. Firstly, As you mentioned to me, the background had better be described on the sheet. People might want to know the background of your choice of topic. And if you want to emphasize some portions, like numbers, values, etc, you should bold and bigger font rather than just writing with normal-sized font. And finally, some graphs are a little bit ambiguous for me to understand. For example at Popularity ranking, it is not easy to understand which is top-ranked and which is not. This had better be improved. Meanwhile, the topic is nice, I also want to attend the class to see your presentation.<br>

Me: Thanks, I will update what you suggested. In terms of graphs, I am still updating them. Once updated I will show you. Thank you for your time.<br>

Person 1: All the best! And I have never seen a wireframe tool, PowerPoint seems to be better. This is just my thought. Anyway good luck!<br>
