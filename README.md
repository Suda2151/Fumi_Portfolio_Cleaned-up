This is the cleaned-up version.

# Fumi Sudare-portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
My name is Takafumi Sudare.
I have no pronouns.
My program is MISM 16 months, and this semester is the 2nd semester for me.
I'm interested in AI architecture. 
I belong to a bank as an employee even now. So after graduating from the program, I will go back to the bank and 
hand down what I learned here to my colleagues.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to use data visualization skills to show information appropriately. 
I'm interested in how does the "Controlling color" works for people who see presentation materials.
